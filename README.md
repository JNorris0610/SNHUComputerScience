# SNHUComputerScience
I am Joanna Norris.
In this repository, I have included work samples from my Computer Science course at SNHU.

The file Sprint review Joanna Norris is an example of work that I have completed in order to practice taking a client's desires, incorporating them, and reflecting upon the outcome. 
Creating "user stories" is a fantastic way to manage and organize features and ideas that are desired by a client. In the product associated with the Sprint review, I was able to create user stories from the feedback of the customer and organize it in a way that was beneficial to my team.

I have learned that it is best to approach developing programs based off of the desired organizational structure and the level of clarification and visualization given by a client of their prospective product. 
I hope to be able to incorporate Scrum processes in my future development work. Whether working at a larger scale or just a handful of people, Scrum allows for much flexibility, teamwork, and effectiveness when working on a project. 
When working in software development, it is all about being able to work as a team and being a good team member. A good team member is one who not only is cross-functional, but communicates well, stays on task, works well with others, and is goal driven. 
In this field, time and functionality are of the essence. Therefore, if a team member can contribute to these ways and ensure fluidity as a team, he is valuable.
